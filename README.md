## Production deployment (using Heroku) 

### Prerequisites

- Deploy the API, tutorial [here](https://github.com/awi2017-option1group3/Prello-API#production-deployment-using-heroku)

### Deployment

On the Heroku website:

1. Create an Heroku app.
2. Using the panel "Settings", set the React buildback to your app : `https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git`
3. Using the panel "Settings", add the config variable `REACT_APP_API_URL` (replace `{api-name}` by the name of the other Heroku instance hosting the API): `https://{api-name}.herokuapp.com/`

In a new tab (keep the Heroku website in background), go to the API Client Registration page: `https://{api-name}.herokuapp.com/auth/clients` and fill the form to get your tokens.

In a new tab (keep the Heroku website in background), go to the Google developer console page: `https://console.developers.google.com/` . Create your new project, activate the Google Picker API and get you API key and ID CLient Auth key

On the Heroku website:

4. Always in the "Settings" panel, add also two other config variables retrieved from the API Client Registration page:
 Â 
  * `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`, with the value of `client_id` 
  * `REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`, with the value of `client_secret`
  
5. Always in the "Settings" panel, add two other config variables retrieved from the Google Developer Console page:

 * `REACT_APP_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID`, with the value of `id_client_auth` 
 * `REACT_APP_DRIVE_DEVELOPER_KEY`, with the value of `developer_api_key`
  
  
5. Using the panel "Deploy", link the github repository to your app (and enable automatic deploys).
6. Using the panel "Deploy", deploy the master branch (at the end of the page). This action can take a while.
7. Open the app using the "Open app" top-right button.

### Usage

You can use the Client with: `https://{app-name}.herokuapp.com/`.
